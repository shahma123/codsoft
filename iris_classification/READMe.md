Iris Flower Classification

1.Objective This task focuses on classifying Iris flowers into three species: ⦁ Setosa ⦁ Versicolor ⦁ Virginica

-using four features from the Iris dataset:
⦁ Sepal length ⦁ Sepal width ⦁ Petal length ⦁ Petal width

2.Tools Used ⦁ Python ⦁ NumPy, Pandas ⦁ Scikit-learn ⦁ Joblib

Models Used ⦁ StandardScaler ⦁ Logistic Regression (multinomial)
4.Files ⦁ notebook.ipynb ⦁ iris_dataset.csv ⦁ iris_model.pkl ⦁ iris_summary.md

5.How to Run

Open the notebook (notebook.ipynb)
Run all cells in order
The notebook will display accuracy, a classification report, and confusion matrix
Conclusion The model successfully learns the patterns in the Iris dataset and accurately classifies iris flowers into their correct species.
